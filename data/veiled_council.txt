The Veiled Council serves as a stabilizing force in your fantasy setting. When they step in, their authority is rarely questioned, making their decrees and interventions a significant part of the narrative, be it in quelling a supernatural uprising or mediating disputes among powerful factions.



Creating detailed characters from each of these sects, with personal backstories and motivations, can make The Veiled Council and your campaign world even more immersive and engaging for your players. Happy world-building!
