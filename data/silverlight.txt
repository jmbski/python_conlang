Silverlight is the name of a planet in a D&D campaign setting I am working on. Silverlight is a planet with rings like Saturn. These rings are made of crytal, silver, and other shiny metals. Silver on the surface though is actually rarer than gold, and thus gold pieces and silver pieces are swapped in value. The local star is a white dwarf, which affects many things about the planet. Silverlight also has no moons orbiting it.
